## Overview

ATT is an engineering thesis diploma project, the main goal of which is developing a fully autonomous turret capable of detecting, tracking and (hopefully) shooting down targets in real-time.
As the main frame of the turret is already built, the main focus of the thesis is on the software side of the project, specifically on the mathematical modeling of the target object, i.e. predicting its future position based on the current one, and on the implementation of a control system that will allow the turret to aim at the target with high accuracy.

This project is being developed by a student from the Gdańsk University of Technology, Poland, as a part of their Engineering degree in Automation and Robotics.

### Project objectives

- Designing and building a 2-DOF turret chassis with a camera and a paintball gun mounted on it.
- Implementing a computer vision system for target detection and tracking.
- Developing a mathematical model for predicting the future position of the target.
- Creating a control system for aiming the turret with high accuracy.
- Testing the system in real-time scenarios and evaluating its performance.
- Documenting the entire development process and presenting the results in a thesis report.
